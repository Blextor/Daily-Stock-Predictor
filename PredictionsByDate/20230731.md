### Info

I have several models that predict between 0.5 and -0.5 whether the stock will go up or down that day. 

Using them together produces even more certain results, so I include 4 conclusions at the end of the table which groups of models provided the most accurate predictions based on testing. One of the 4 groups was best at predicting a decrease, two at predicting an increase, and the fourth at predicting a general shift. Therefore the last 4 columns are the two up, down and overall.

There are times when none of the listed stocks have a common outcome between the models. It is common that there is no common outcome for a stock.

### Important
It is not suitable for forecasting stocks that are affected by current or expected news. Such as economic indicators, financial reports, dividend payments, and other major news.

It is also not suitable when the opening or closing of the market is out of the ordinary.

# Results
| Stocks | Buy or Sell | Open | Close | DiffRate | RealRate |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |




### Info
I always update at the end of the day based on the predicted results to see how the forecast performed that day. All stocks will be included, even those that are affected by various news.

The difference between DiffRate and RealRate is that I include management fees in the latter. This cost is 0.2% for buying and 0.5% for selling.
