<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><h1>Daily Stock Predictor</h1><p>This project analyzes the market condition of various stocks every day and predicts the value movements expected by the end of the day. Multiple models are run within the project, making different predictions. Predictions are updated every day at 10:05 AM, predicting whether the value of the stocks will be higher or lower than at 10:05 AM by 3:55 PM.</p><p>The predictions can be found in the <code>Predictions</code> folder, where files are organized by year and month, with each stock having its own folder. For example, the prediction for Microsoft stocks on July 3, 2023, can be found in the <code>Predictions-&gt;2023-07-&gt;MSFT-&gt;2023-07-03-MSFT.txt</code> file. A single file may contain multiple predictions from different models, each prediction following the 'up' or 'down' format.</p><p>In the <code>Results</code> folder, we compile the potential revenue obtained per stock.</p><p>The goal of the project is to aid stock traders in tracking market trends and supporting their future investment decisions.</p><h2>File Format</h2><p>The files containing the predictions follow the format:</p><pre><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-makefile"><span class="hljs-section">Model1: up</span>
<span class="hljs-section">Model2: down</span>
